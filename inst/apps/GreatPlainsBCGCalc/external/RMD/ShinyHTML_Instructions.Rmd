The BCG models are calibrated for specific collection and processing
protocols. Make sure you are using the BCG model that is appropriate for
your samples.

### Workflow

![](images/Workflow_20240626.jpg){width="50%"}

### [Prepare Data]{.underline}

**Create input file**. The input file can include data for multiple
samples, sites and Index Classes.

Decide on a pathway:

-   Within app: *File Builder*

-   Outside app: Already formatted

**Import file.**

If using the **Outside app: Already Formatted option, skip to the
Calculation step** below.

If using the *File Builder* option, **select the desired Calculation and
run the *File Builder*** (see instructions on the *File Builder* page).
The *File Builder* will join the taxa names in the input file with the
‘original taxaID’ column in the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools_SupportFiles/tree/main/data/taxa_official/GP" target="blank">Taxa
Translator table</a> and performs two functions:

-   Translate the original taxon name to the proper Operational
    Taxonomic Unit (OTU) for the calculation.

-   Add in new columns with taxa attributes and hierarchy (e.g., Order,
    Family) that are needed for the metric calculations.

**Download and unzip the results**. A ‘results’ folder will appear, with
the following subfolders:

```{r table_req}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
#library(DT)

# Data
fn <- "Instructions.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "Subfolders")

df %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

In the subfolders for each calculation, there will be four *File
Builder* output files, described below.

```{r table_req2}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
#library(DT)

# Data
fn <- "Instructions.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "FB_Output")

df %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

When the *File Builder* has finished running, **a prompt box will
appear**. It will notify you if your *File Builder* run was successful
or failed. Or, in some cases (e.g., if there are problems with your
input file), the screen will gray out (meaning the Shiny app has
crashed) and you’ll have to refresh the app, investigate potential
problems with your input file, and try again.

If your run was successful, the prompt box will alert you if there are
taxa in your input file that don’t match with the taxa list in the Taxa
Translator table.

**What if there are non-matching taxa?** Open the
‘XXX_TaxaTranslator_nonmatch’ file and view the list of non-matching
taxa. If the non-matches are due to a misspelling, extra space or other
small issue, fix the non-matching taxa in your input file, re-upload the
file via the ‘Import File’ tab, and rerun the *File Builder* (and to
prevent confusion, delete the first set of output files with the
non-matching taxa). If the non-matching taxa are legitimate taxa that
need to be added to the Taxa Translator table, notify
[Jen.Stamp\@tetratech.com](mailto:Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com) and Tetra
Tech will update the Taxa Translator table as soon as resources permit.

Next, **import the newly created ‘XXX_TaxaTranslator_TAXAATTR’ file**.

#### [Calculation]{.underline}

**Go to the Calculation tab and run the selected calculation**.

Note: the default setting is for the R code to
<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/raw/main/inst/apps/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/www/links/RedundantTaxa_20240719.pdf" target="blank">mark
redundant/non-distinct taxa</a>. If you want to use an alternate scheme,
uncheck the box, include your designations (TRUE/FALSE) in the input
file and name the column ‘EXCLUDE.’

The R code will perform the following steps:

BCG

1.  Mark non-distinct taxa (excluded from richness metrics)

2.  Calculate metric values for each sample

3.  Calculate BCG metric membership values for each sample

4.  Assign each sample membership in a BCG level

**Download and unzip the results**. The files will be added to the
appropriate subfolder (depending on the Calculation). Note: you will
receive a prompt saying that the destination folder already contains the
‘XXX_TaxaTranslator_TAXAATTR’ file and asking if you’d like to replace
the existing file. Click ‘Yes to All.’

**Open the subfolder and view the outputs**.

List of BCG outputs.

```{r table_req3}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
#library(DT)

# Data
fn <- "Instructions.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "BCG_Output")

df %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

Want more information on the BCG? See the References tab.

Having problems? See the Troubleshooting tab.

**Time saver tip:**

Some internet browsers, like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, allow
you to change settings so that you can select which folder to download
files to (versus files going to the default Download folder).

    [<a href="https://tetratech-wtr-wne.shinyapps.io/ContDataQC_EPAtemplate/_w_18ec5e9f/GoogleChrome_TimesaverTips.pdf" target="blank">PDF</a>]

-   Mozilla Firefox: go to Settings \> General \> Files and Applications
    \> Check box for “always ask where to save files.”

#### [Merge Files]{.underline}

If you want to combine the BCG and IBI results into one file and have a
common identifier field in the two files (e.g., SampleID), use the
‘Merge files’ function under the Prepare Data tab.

#### [Map]{.underline}

When you run the BCG Calculator, the \_BCG_RESULTS (CSV) output will
include the results plus the SampleID, Index_Name and Index_Class
columns. None of the other fields will be carried through. To use the
Map function, you’ll need to add latitude and longitude into the input
file. This join can be done outside the app or within (using the Merge
Files function).

1.  Import the file

2.  Go to the Map tab

3.  Use the drop-down menus to match required column names with the
    fields in your input file

4.  Click the ‘update map’ button

5.  Interact with the map as desired (zoom in/out, click on dots to view
    sample information, change the base layer if desired by clicking on
    the box in the upper right)
