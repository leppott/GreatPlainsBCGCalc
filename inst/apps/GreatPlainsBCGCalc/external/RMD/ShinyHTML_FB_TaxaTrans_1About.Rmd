# Prepare an input file with *File Builder*

The BCG models are calibrated for specific collection and processing
protocols. Make sure you are using the BCG model that is appropriate for
your samples.

EXAMPLE INPUT FILES

    [<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/raw/main/inst/apps/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/www/links/TestFiles_FileBuilder_Bugs_20240730.zip" target="blank">ZIP</a>]

-   Fish
    [<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/raw/main/inst/apps/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/www/links/TestFiles_FileBuilder_Fish_20240730.zip" target="blank">ZIP</a>]

The File Builder joins the taxon name in the input file with the
‘original taxaID’ column in the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/BioMonTools_SupportFiles/tree/main/data/taxa_official/GP" target="blank">Taxa
Translator table</a> and performs two functions:

-   Translates the original taxon name to the proper OTU for the
    calculation.

-   Adds in new columns with taxa attributes and hierarchy (e.g., Order,
    Family) that are needed for the metric calculations.

The input file must be a comma-separated file (CSV).

<a href="https://github.com/Blocktt/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/raw/main/inst/apps/GreatPlainsBCGCalc/www/links/IndexNameClass_20240730.zip" target="blank">Index
Name and Index Class</a> are required for all calculations (they tell R
which BCG rules and IBI metrics to apply). See tables at bottom of page.

The input file must be a comma-separated file (CSV). It can include data
for multiple samples, sites and Index Classes.

Required fields for all calculations. Column names are flexible (use
drop-down menus to match).

```{r table_req}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Data
fn <- "Requirements.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "Req_metadata")

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

There is **one additional required field for the Iowa bug BCG** (column
name must match exactly):

-   BugGear (text entries: Qualitative, Surber, Hess, Artificial
    Substrate, Low-Flow Artificial Substrate and Anchored Artifical
    Substrate)

Optional fields (e.g., SiteID, latitude, longitude, collection date) can
be selected as well and will be carried through into the File Builder
output file.

IMPORTANT! Do not include Life Stage or other fields that might cause a
taxon to occur in more than one row for a given sample (which could lead
to double-counting of that taxon in the richness metrics).

Below are the unique combinations of INDEX_NAME and INDEX_CLASS and
descriptions of how sites should be correctly assigned.

**Fish**

```{r table_req3}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Data
fn <- "Requirements.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "Fish_classes")

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```

**Bugs (as of 07/30/2024; more Index Classes will be added)**

```{r table_req4}
# Packages
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Data
fn <- "Requirements.xlsx"
path <- file.path("files", fn)
df <- read_excel(path, sheet = "Bug_classes")

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df %>%
  kable(escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```
